# Wave-propagation
## 1. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (1D Wave) 
### Problem Statement
#### Partial Differential Equation (PDE):
$\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}\$
#### Boundary Conditions:
$u(0,t) = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad u(1,t) = 0\$
#### Initial Conditions:
$u(x,0) = x(1 - x)\$

$\\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}(x, 0) = 0\$  where \( 0 < x < 1 \) and \( t > 0 \).
